ASP MVC C#

This was written with Visual Studio 2017.  
Clone this repository and open the MLB Code Challenge.sln.
After that you must build the solution. Build | Build Solution
Then you will run the program by selecting Debug | Start Debugging or selecting the Run icon on your tool bar â–¶

Code Features
========
The project is an Model View Controller project, so there are the respected Model, View, Controllers directories.

Controllers Directory  
HomeController.cs  
```c#
public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            //read in from the web the team data
            //create the service 
            var teamService = new TeamsService();

            //get the Org data from the service
            MLBOrganization org = teamService.GetMLBStandings();

            //set up the Model for the view

            return View("Index",org);
        }

    }
```  
As you can see the HomeController creates an instance of the TeamService object that retrieves the information from the web from the link that was provided.  https://api.mobileqa.mlbinfra.com/api/interview/v1/records
After the TeamService object is created, the GetMLBStandings parses out the JSON records and creates an MLBOrganization object, whic contain all of the Leagues, Divisions, and Teams in a sorted order.  

The Index page is then started, and the MLBOrganization object is passed to it as a Razor object.

Models Directory  
These are basically the POCO objects created to for the information.  

Services Directory  
There is one file, TeamsServices.cs which is a file that downloads the JSON data and creates a MLBOrgganization object.  

```c#
    public class TeamsService
    {

        public MLBOrganization GetMLBStandings()
        {
            //URL with the data
            var url = "https://api.mobileqa.mlbinfra.com/api/interview/v1/records";

            List<TeamDataRecord> records = new List<TeamDataRecord>();

            //make the call to the webservice
            using (WebClient webClient = new WebClient())
            {
                records = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<TeamDataRecord>>(webClient.DownloadString(url));
            }

            MLBOrganization organization = new MLBOrganization(records);

            return organization;

        }
    }

```

Views Directory  
In the Views\Home Directory there is an Index.cshtml file that displays the data.  
Leagues have their own tab, and the teams fade in when displayed.  
```html
<!-- setup the league tabs -->
    <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
        @{

            Boolean firstTab = true;
            foreach (MLB.Models.League league in Model.leagues)
            {
                //name the tab #href to the league name

                <li class=@(firstTab?"active":"")><a data-toggle="tab" href="#@league.leagueName"><img src="@Url.Content(league.iconImagePath)" alt="" style="height:48px;width:48px;" />@league.leagueName</a></li>
                firstTab = false;

            }
        }
    </ul>
```

Code Hilights
--- 
Robust, if the data changes , for example a new league ( say Canadian League or Cuban League) is added, this code will handle it and its divisions and teams.  

Use of bootstrap for visual display, as well as icons were used.
